# 3.2 JS Arrays & Objects – Worksheet
## Mini FRQ – School System Navigator

You will design a few helper functions for navigating a `schoolSystem` object like the one in the reading.

---

### Part 1 – Data Shape

Describe (in words or a small diagram) how the nested structure of `schoolSystem` works:

- schools
- classRooms
- teachers
- students



---

### Part 2 – Required Functions

Write pseudocode for each function:

1. `listAllSchoolNames(schoolSystem)`  
   - Print the name of every school.

2. `listAllStudentsInSchool(schoolSystem, schoolIndex)`  
   - Print the first and last name of every student in the selected school.

3. `findStudentInSystem(schoolSystem, firstName)`  
   - Search through all schools and classrooms.
   - When you find a student with that first name, print their full name and which school they are in.



---

### Part 3 – Edge Cases

What should happen if:

- The schoolSystem has no schools?
- A school has no classrooms?
- A classroom has no students?
- `findStudentInSystem` doesn’t find any student with that name?

Write 1–2 sentences for each case.
