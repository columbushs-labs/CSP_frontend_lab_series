# 3.2 JS Arrays & Objects – Worksheet
## Multiple Structures Practice

---

### Part A – Declare Nested Structures

1. Write JavaScript code to create an array `groups` with 2 inner arrays of names.

Example shape:

```js
const groups = [
  ["Alice", "Bob"],
  ["Charlie", "Dana"]
];
```


2. Write JavaScript code to create an array `people` that stores 3 objects with keys: `firstName` and `age`.


---

### Part B – Access Values

Using your `groups` array:

3. Write a line of code that logs the first element of the second group.

Using your `people` array:

4. Write a line of code that logs the age of the second person using dot notation.


---

### Part C – Add and Update

5. Write code that adds a new name to the **first group** in `groups` using `push`.

6. Write code that changes the `age` of the first person in `people` to a new number.


---

### Part D – Mix Objects and Arrays

7. Write JavaScript code to create a `classRoom` object with:

- a `teacher` object (with `firstName`, `lastName`)
- a `students` array with at least 2 student objects

8. Write code that logs the first student’s first name from your `classRoom` object.
