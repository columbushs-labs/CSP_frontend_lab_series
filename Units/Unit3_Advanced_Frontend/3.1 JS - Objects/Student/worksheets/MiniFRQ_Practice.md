# 3.1 JS Objects – Worksheet
## Mini FRQ – Library and Users

You will plan a small library system using objects and arrays.

---

### Part 1 – Data Model

Write a description (in words or bullet points) of how you would model:

- a single `book`
- a single `user`
- a `library` that holds multiple users

Think about which parts should be objects and which should be arrays.



---

### Part 2 – Required Behavior

Describe, in pseudocode, how to:

1. Add a new `book` to a specific user.
2. List all book titles for a specific user.
3. List all users and how many books each one has.




---

### Part 3 – Edge Cases

What should happen if:

- You try to list books for a user that has **no books**?
- The library has **no users**?

Write 1–2 sentences for each.
