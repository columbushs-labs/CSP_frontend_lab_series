# Pseudocode Practice – Selecting & Updating Elements

Write pseudocode for each scenario:

1. Select an element with id "notice" and change its text to "Updated!"
2. Select all elements with class "card" and add a border to each one.
3. Select all buttons inside a section with id "controls" and attach a click
   handler that logs the button's text content.
