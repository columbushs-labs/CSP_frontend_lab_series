# Pseudocode Practice – Creating & Removing Elements

Write pseudocode for each scenario:

1. Add a new list item
   - There is a `<ul id="tasks">` and an input with id `"task-input"`.
   - When a button is clicked, create a new `<li>` with the input's value and append it to the list.

2. Remove a clicked item
   - For each `<li>` in the list, attach a click event that removes that specific `<li>` from the DOM.

3. Clear a section
   - There is a `<div id="messages">` with several child elements.
   - Write pseudocode to remove all its children using `innerHTML`.
