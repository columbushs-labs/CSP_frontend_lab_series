# Pseudocode Practice – TDD Loop

For each scenario, write pseudocode for the TDD process (what tests you would write first, then
how you would implement the function).

1. Function `isEven(n)` that returns true if `n` is even, false otherwise.

2. Function `maxOfThree(a, b, c)` that returns the largest of the three numbers.

3. Function `countVowels(str)` that returns how many vowels are in a string.
