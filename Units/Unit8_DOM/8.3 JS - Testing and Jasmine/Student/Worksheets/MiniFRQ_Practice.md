# Mini FRQ – Designing Tests

You want to write a function `min(array)` that returns the smallest number in an array.

### Part (a)
Write **three different test cases** you would include in a Jasmine spec for `min(array)`.
For each case, describe the input and the expected output.

### Part (b)
Describe how you would test what happens if:

- The array is empty.
- No parameter is provided at all.

Would you return a value or throw an error? Explain your design choice.

### Part (c)
Explain how having these tests in place would help you later if you needed to change or
optimize the implementation of `min(array)`.
