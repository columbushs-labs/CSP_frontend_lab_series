# Mini FRQ – Error Handling & User Experience

A small app crashes when a user types letters instead of numbers into a form. Right now it just shows
a red error in the console and nothing changes on the page.

(a) Explain why this is a bad user experience in 2–3 sentences.

(b) Describe how you would use `try/catch` and custom error messages to improve the situation.

(c) Write a short code snippet that:
- Tries to convert user input to a number.
- Throws an Error if the input is invalid.
- Catches the Error and shows a friendly message in a `<p id="error">` on the page.
