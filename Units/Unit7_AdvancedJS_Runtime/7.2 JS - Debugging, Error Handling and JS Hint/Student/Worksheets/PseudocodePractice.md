# Pseudocode Practice – Debugging Strategy

Write pseudocode for a debugging strategy for a broken function `calculate()`:

1. How would you reproduce the bug?
2. Where would you place breakpoints?
3. What values would you watch while stepping through the code?
4. How would you decide whether to fix the **inputs**, the **logic**, or both?
