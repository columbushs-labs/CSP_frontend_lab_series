1. In your own words, what is the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** code?
2. What does `setTimeout` do? What are its two main arguments?
3. What does `setInterval` do? How is it different from `setTimeout`?
4. What is a **callback function**?
5. Why can a callback be called *later*, even if it is defined earlier in the file?
