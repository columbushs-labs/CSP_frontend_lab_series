# Pseudocode Practice – Timers & Callbacks

Write pseudocode for each scenario:

1. A function `waitAndGreet(name)` that waits 2 seconds and then logs "Hello, <name>!".
2. A function `repeatEverySecond(message)` that logs a message every second until another
   function `stopRepeating()` is called.
3. A function `getData(callback)` that "pretends" to fetch data, then calls the callback
   with that data after a short delay.
