# Pseudocode Practice – Scope & Hoisting

Write pseudocode for:

1. A function that uses a local variable and logs it, then show what happens if you try to log it outside the function.
2. A for loop using let for the counter and explain what happens if you try to use the counter after the loop.
3. A short hoisting demo with var where you log a variable before and after its declaration.
