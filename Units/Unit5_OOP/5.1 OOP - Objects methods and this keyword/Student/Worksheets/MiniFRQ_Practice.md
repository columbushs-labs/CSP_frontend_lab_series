# Mini FRQ Practice – OOP: Objects, Methods & `this`

**Prompt:**

You are designing an app that tracks reading progress for a single book. You decide to use an object called `bookTracker`.

### Part (a)

Write an object literal `bookTracker` with the following:

- Properties:
  - `title` (string)
  - `totalPages` (number)
  - `pagesRead` (number, start at 0)
- Methods:
  - `read(pages)` – adds `pages` to `pagesRead`
  - `getProgress()` – returns a string like `"You have read 40% of Intro to JS."`

Use `this` inside the methods where appropriate.

_Write your object here:_



### Part (b)

Explain in 1–2 sentences how `this.totalPages` and `this.pagesRead` work inside the `getProgress()` method.

_Answer:_



### Part (c)

Write a short code segment that:

- Calls `bookTracker.read(50);`
- Calls `bookTracker.getProgress();` and logs the returned string
