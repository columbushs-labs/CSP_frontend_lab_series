# Pseudocode Practice – OOP: Objects, Methods & `this`

Write pseudocode for each scenario. Focus on describing **what** the object and its methods should do.

---

### Scenario 1 – Player object

Design a `player` object for a board game. It should have:

- A name
- A position on the board
- A number of coins
- A method `move()` that moves the player forward by the value of a dice roll
- A method `displayInfo()` that prints the current state

### Scenario 2 – Timer object

Design a `timer` object that:

- Starts at 0 seconds
- Has a method `start()` (you can just describe what it *would* do)
- Has a method `reset()` that sets the time back to 0
- Has a method `display()` that prints the current time

### Scenario 3 – Joke object

Design a `jokeCollection` object that:

- Has an array of jokes
- Has a method `addJoke(joke)` that adds a new joke
- Has a method `getRandomJoke()` that returns one random joke
