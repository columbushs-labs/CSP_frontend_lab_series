# Pseudocode Practice – OOP: Class & Inheritance

Write pseudocode for each scenario. Focus on describing the classes, their properties, and their relationships.

---

### Scenario 1 – Shape hierarchy

Design a `Shape` base class and two subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

- `Shape` should have a `color` property and a `describe()` method.
- `Rectangle` should have `width` and `height`, and a method `area()`.
- `Circle` should have `radius` and a method `area()`.

### Scenario 2 – User roles

Design a base class `User` and two subclasses `Student` and `Teacher`.

- `User` has `name` and `email` properties.
- `Student` has `gradeLevel` and a method `introduce()`.
- `Teacher` has `subject` and a method `introduce()`.

Explain how `Student` and `Teacher` both reuse code from `User`.

### Scenario 3 – Vehicle inheritance

Design a base class `Vehicle` and a subclass `ElectricCar`.

- `Vehicle` has `brand`, `model`, and `speed`, and a method `accelerate(amount)`.
- `ElectricCar` adds a `batteryLevel` property and a method `charge(percent)`.
