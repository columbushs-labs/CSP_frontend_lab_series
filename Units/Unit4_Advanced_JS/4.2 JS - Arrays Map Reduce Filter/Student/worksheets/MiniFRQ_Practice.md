# 4.2 JS Arrays – Map, Reduce & Filter – Worksheet
## Mini FRQ – Data Analytics with Array Methods

You are helping a small app analyze some data using `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`.

---

### Part 1 – Describe the Tools

In 2–3 sentences, describe when you would choose:

- .map()
- .reduce()
- .filter()



---

### Part 2 – Pseudocode a Pipeline

You receive an array of products, each with `name`, `price`, and `inStock` properties.

Write pseudocode for a function that:

1. Uses .filter() to keep only the products that are `inStock`.
2. Uses .map() to extract just the prices.
3. Uses .reduce() to calculate the **total value of stock** for the products that are in stock.



---

### Part 3 – Edge Cases

What happens in your algorithm if:

- There are **no** products in stock?
- The array is empty?
- Some products have a price of `0`?

Write 1–2 sentences for each case.
