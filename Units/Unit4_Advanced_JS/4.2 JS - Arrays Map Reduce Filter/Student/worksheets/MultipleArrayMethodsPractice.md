# 4.2 JS Arrays – Map, Reduce & Filter – Worksheet
## Multiple Array Methods Practice

---

### Part A – map

1. Use .map() to turn `[1, 2, 3, 4]` into `[1, 4, 9, 16]` (each number squared).

2. Use .map() to turn an array of words into an array of their lengths:
   - Input: `["hello", "ironhack", "arrays"]`
   - Output: `[5, 8, 6]`


---

### Part B – reduce

3. Use .reduce() to find the **product** of `[2, 3, 4]`.

4. Use .reduce() with an initial value of `10` to sum `[1, 2, 3]` and add it to `10`.


---

### Part C – filter

5. Use .filter() to keep only numbers greater than `50` from:
   - `[10, 60, 30, 80, 55]`

6. Use .filter() to keep only words with length **3 or less** from:
   - `["cat", "lion", "dog", "fish"]`


---

### Part D – Combine methods

7. Given:
   ```js
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
   ```
   - First use .filter() to keep only even numbers.
   - Then use .map() to double those even numbers.
   - Final result should be: `[4, 8, 12]`
