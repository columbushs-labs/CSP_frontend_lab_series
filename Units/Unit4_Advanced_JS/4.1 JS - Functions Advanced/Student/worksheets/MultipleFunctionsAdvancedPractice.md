# 4.1 JS Functions Advanced – Worksheet
## Multiple Functions Advanced Practice

---

### Part A – Declarations and Expressions

1. Write a **function declaration** called `sayHi` that logs `"Hi!"`.

2. Rewrite `sayHi` as a **function expression** stored in a `const` called `sayHiExpr`.

### Part B – Callbacks

3. Write a function `doTwice(callback)` that calls the `callback` function two times.

4. Write code that calls `doTwice` with:

   - a named function that logs `"Named callback"`
   - an anonymous function that logs `"Anonymous callback"`

### Part C – Arrow Functions

5. Write an arrow function `square` that returns the square of a number.

6. Write an arrow function `greet` that takes a name and returns `"Hello, <name>!"`.

### Part D – The arguments Object

7. Write a regular function `logFirstTwo` (not arrow) that uses `arguments` to log the first two arguments.

8. Write a function `countArgs` that returns how many arguments it received using `arguments.length`.
