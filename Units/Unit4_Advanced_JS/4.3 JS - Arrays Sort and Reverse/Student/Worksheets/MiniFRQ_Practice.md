# Mini FRQ Practice – JS Arrays: sort() & reverse()

**Prompt:**

A music app stores songs in an array. Each song is represented as an object with two properties:

```js
{
  title: "Song name",
  plays: 1234   // number of times the song has been played
}
```

You are given an array named `songs`:

```js
const songs = [
  { title: "Shine", plays: 90 },
  { title: "Echo", plays: 150 },
  { title: "Wave", plays: 120 }
];
```

### Part (a)

Write a code segment that sorts the `songs` array so that the song with the **highest** number of `plays` comes first.

- You must use **`.sort()` with a compare function**.
- After sorting, log the updated `songs` array.

### Part (b)

Explain in 1–2 sentences whether your solution in part (a) **mutates** the original `songs` array or leaves it unchanged, and **why**.

_Answer:_



### Part (c)

Write a single line of code that reverses the order of the `songs` array after part (a) and logs the result.
