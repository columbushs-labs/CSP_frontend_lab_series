# Pseudocode Practice – JS Arrays: sort() & reverse()

Write step-by-step instructions (pseudocode) for each scenario **before** you code.

---

### Scenario 1 – Smallest to largest (numbers)

You are given an array of test scores:

```js
const scores = [88, 92, 70, 100, 95];
```

Write pseudocode for a function that:

- sorts the scores from **smallest to largest** using `.sort()` with a compare function, and  
- prints the lowest and highest score.

### Scenario 2 – Longest word first

You have an array of words:

```js
const words = ["cat", "hippopotamus", "dog", "turtle"];
```

Write pseudocode to:

- sort the array so the **longest** word is first and the shortest word is last.

### Scenario 3 – Most recent message

You are building a chat app. Each message object looks like this:

```js
const messages = [
  { text: "hey", timestamp: 170 },
  { text: "what's up", timestamp: 210 },
  { text: "ok", timestamp: 190 }
];
```

Write pseudocode to:

- sort the messages so the **most recent** message (largest `timestamp`) is first.

### Scenario 4 – Reverse a feed

You fetch a list of posts from an API and it gives you the posts in **oldest → newest** order.

Write pseudocode that:

- uses `.reverse()` to display posts as **newest → oldest**.
